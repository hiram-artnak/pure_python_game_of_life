# Game of Life
A simple "Game of Life" that runs on your terminal.

If you call it on its own it will generate a random 25x25 soup, 
but you can also feed it a .txt file containing only "0"s and "1"s as its first argument.
It will then load the file as the map, interpreting "0"s as dead cells and "1"s as alive cells.

I.E.:
```
0110
1001
1001
0110
```
